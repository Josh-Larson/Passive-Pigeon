# Passive Pigeon
### A Passive Enumeration Tool

The goal of this project is to have a completely passive tool for enumerating local area network devices.

 This tool passively collects data about devices on your current network including, but not limited to, TVs, laptops, phones, smart tv sticks, smart home devices, and spotify players. 

 The most important detail about this tool is that it doesn't send out **any** data, just collects what's out there
